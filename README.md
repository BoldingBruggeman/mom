# The Modular Ocean Model with FABM support

This is a fork of the Modular Ocean Model (MOM) that adds support for the [Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models (FABM)](http://fabm.net).
This code is developed and maintained by Bolding and Bruggeman ApS.
Currently FABM support is implemented for the 5.1.0 stable release of MOM; the associated code is available under branch `5.1.0-fabm`.

MOM is a numerical ocean model based on the hydrostatic primitive equations. Development of the model is managed through the Model Development Lab at
